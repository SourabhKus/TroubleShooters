defined(func, type)
Returns true if func is defined; type must be either test or replace, to match defineTest or defineReplace.

equals(var1, var)
(also works as isEqual).
Returns true if var1 is equal to var2 (string comparison).

lessThan(var1, var2)`
Returns true if var1 is less than var2 (as an integer).

greaterThan(var1, var2)
Returns true if var1 is greater than var2 (as an integer).

inFile(file, var, val)
Returns true if a variable var is defined in the specified file. Additionally, it can test to see if it has the requested value.

load(string)
Something of a cross between include() and CONFIG += [feature]. load(foo) will look for a file called 
"foo.prf" in the standard feature path, and execute its contents immediately. Features that are 
contained within CONFIG are executed last, after the ".pro" file has finished processing. 
Like include(), it will return true if the file was found.
